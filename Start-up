Input for a turn
Line 1 : 11 integers id, playerCount, turn, income, cash, devs, sellers, managers, features, tests and bugs where:

id : your startUp id
playerCount : number of players
turn : number of turn since the beginning
income : your income for this turn
cash : cash of your start-up
devs : developers employees of your start-up
sellers : sellers employees of your start-up
managers : managers employees of your start-up
features : features developed in your software
tests : tests developed in your software
bugs : bugs in your software
playerCount following lines : one line for each player. First line is for player 0, next one for player 1, etc. Each line contains 3 integers startUpId start-up id, marketShare start-up market share in thousandths and reputation start-up reputation

Output for a turn
One line containing 5 or 6 integers separated by space devsToHire, sellersToHire, managersToHire, maintenanceDevs, competitiveSellers and targetId which is optional
Constraints for output values:

-1 ≤ managersToHire ≤ 1
|devsToHire| + |sellersToHire| ≤ 2 × managers where |n| means absolute value of n
0 ≤ maintenanceDevs ≤ devs + devsToHire
0 ≤ competitiveSellers ≤ sellers + sellersToHire
devs + devsToHire + sales + salesToHire ≤ 10 × managers
devsToHire: number of developers you want to hire for next round, it can be negative.
sellersToHire: number of sellers you want to hire for next round, it can be negative.
managersToHire: number of managers you want to hire for next round, it can be negative.
maintenanceDevs: number of your developers affected to fix bugs and increase tests.
Beware tests number can be increased only if a feature already exists or has been developed during the turn.
competitiveSellers: sellers that will try to steal market share from competitors.
targetId must be a startUp id (different from your id). This output is optional.
